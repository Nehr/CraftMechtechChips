# CraftMechtechChips
RimWorld mod for Biotech to craft high mechtech chips.

## About

### Craft Signal chips, Powerfocus chips and Nano structuring chips.

Unlock the ability to craft mechtech chips through research after you've studied the chips. Instead of fighting the same bosses over and over again in order to get mechtech chips this mod gives you the option to also craft them.

## In-game values
### Research time
Requires Multi analyzer.
- Signal chip: 2000
- Powerfocus chip: 4000
- Nanostructuring chip: 6000
### Crafting costs
Requires Fabrication bench.
#### Signal chip
- Basic subcore (1)
- Plasteel (125)
- Uranium (5)
#### Powerfocus chip
- Standard subcore (1)
- Signal chip (2)
- Plasteel (150)
#### Nano structuring chip
- High subcore (1)
- Powerfocus chip (2)
- Plasteel (150)
- Uranium (10)
### Skills needed to craft
- Signal chip: 9 crafting (can be crafted by fabricators)
- Powerfocus chip: 10 crafting (can be crafted by fabricators)
- Nano structuring chip: 10 crafting, 16 intellectual (must be crafted by a colonist)
### Amount of work (time)
- Signal chip: 8000
- Powerfocus chip: 10000
- Nano structuring chip: 12000
## Patch notes
### 1.2
- I find that by end-game my subcore crafting bench and scanners just sit there which is quite boring. So I removed steel and gold cost from crafting the chips and replaced it with subcores to utilize them more. So the chips need one subcore from the respective tier. The actual cost for the chips are about the same, but it requires less different stuff but more streamlined ingredients.
  - Signal chip: Basic subcore
  - Powerfocus chip: Standard subcore
  - Nano structuring chip: High subcore
- Increased workAmount even more
  - Signal chip: 5200 -> 8000
  - Powerfocus chip: 6000 -> 10000
  - Nano structuring chip: 6800 -> 12000
- Reduced plasteel costs considering the cost for subcores
  - Powerfocus chip: 200 -> 150
  - Nano structuring chip: 250 -> 150
### 1.1
  - Decreased overall cost of plasteel by 200 when crafting a Nano structuring chip from scratch
    - Signal chip plasteel cost 150 -> 125
    - Powerfocus chip plasteel cost 225 -> 200
    - Nano structuring chip plasteel cost 300 -> 250
  - Removed Intellectual requirement of crafting Signal chips and Powerfocus chips, so now your fabricators are able to craft them
  - Increased workAmount by a small amount for each chip
