# CraftMechtechChips
RimWorld mod for Biotech to craft high mechtech chips.

## About

### Craft Signal chips, Powerfocus chips and Nano structuring chips.

Unlock the ability to craft mechtech chips through research after you've studied the chips. Instead of fighting the same bosses over and over again in order to get mechtech chips this mod gives you the option to also craft them.

### AlphaMechs support

Now also supports crafting the new mech tech chips added in AlphaMechs: Hyper-linkage chip (tier 4), Stellar processing chip (tier 5) and Quantum matrix chip (tier 6)! If you're using AlphaMechs make sure this mod is loaded after/placed below AlphaMechs in the mod load order.

## Patch notes
### CMC build 1.3
- Changed some costs for crafting the chips, so it needs less raw resources and are utilizing advanced components instead. The total costs are slightly cheaper for the first two chips, slightly more expensive for the third one - but the raw amount of plasteel needed are the same or less. 
- New raw plasteel costs:
  - Signal chip: 125 -> 110
  - Powerfocus chip: 150 -> 135
  - Nano structuring chip: no change
- New raw gold costs:
  - Signal chip: 0 -> 18
  - Powerfocus chip: 0 -> 18
  - Nano structuring chip: 0 -> 24
- Nano structuring chip crafting research time lowered slightly: 6000 -> 5000
- Added a 'Mechtech crafting' tab in the research menu
- Initial support for the mod AlphaMechs (https://github.com/juanosarg/AlphaMechs/tree/main) I may need to tweak some numbers though.
- Added Mechlink crafting. It's not cheap though, it's pretty expensive as it's supposed to be an end-game thing.
### CMC build 1.2
- I find that by end-game my subcore crafting bench and scanners just sit there which is quite boring. So I removed steel and gold cost from crafting the chips and replaced it with subcores to utilize them more. So the chips need one subcore from the respective tier. The actual cost for the chips are about the same, but it requires less different stuff but more streamlined ingredients.
  - Signal chip: Basic subcore
  - Powerfocus chip: Standard subcore
  - Nano structuring chip: High subcore
- Increased workAmount even more
  - Signal chip: 5200 -> 8000
  - Powerfocus chip: 6000 -> 10000
  - Nano structuring chip: 6800 -> 12000
- Reduced plasteel costs considering the cost for subcores
  - Powerfocus chip: 200 -> 150
  - Nano structuring chip: 250 -> 200

Crafting a Nano structuring chip from scratch is now an even 1000 plasteel. But requires some additional work and resources with the addition of subcores.
### CMC build 1.1
  - Decreased overall cost of plasteel by 200 when crafting a Nano structuring chip from scratch
    - Signal chip plasteel cost 150 -> 125
    - Powerfocus chip plasteel cost 225 -> 200
    - Nano structuring chip plasteel cost 300 -> 250
  - Removed Intellectual requirement of crafting Signal chips and Powerfocus chips, so now your fabricators are able to craft them
  - Increased workAmount by a small amount for each chip
